An empirical analysis of household consumption and debt structure using Italian microdata.
# Household Consumption and Debt Structure Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses how household debt structure affects consumption behaviour using micro-level data from the 2020 Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) by the Bank of Italy.

The study examines:
- Differences in consumption patterns across asset-holding groups
- The impact of debt burden on household consumption
- Heterogeneity between high-risk and low-risk asset holders

## Data
- Source: Bank of Italy – SHIW 2020
- Sample size: 6,239 households
- Key variables:
  - Equivalised consumption
  - Debt-to-income ratio
  - Asset holdings
  - Income and demographic controls

## Methodology
- Descriptive statistics
- Mean comparison (t-tests)
- OLS regression analysis
- Heterogeneity analysis

## Key Findings
- Households holding high-risk assets exhibit higher consumption levels.
- Debt burden negatively affects consumption, even after controlling for income.
- Financial vulnerability plays a significant role in consumption behaviour.
